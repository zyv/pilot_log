# EASA Part-FCL & Part-MED Requirements

## FCL.210.A PPL(A) — Experience requirements and crediting

Applicants for a PPL(A) shall have completed at least 45 hours of flight instruction in aeroplanes or TMGs, 5 of which may have been completed in an FSTD, including at least:

1. 25 hours of dual flight instruction; and
2. 10 hours of supervised solo flight time, including at least 5 hours of solo cross-country flight time with at least 1 cross-country flight of at least 270 km (150 NM), during which full stop landings at 2 aerodromes different from the aerodrome of departure shall be made.

## FCL.740 - Validity and renewal of class and type ratings

The period of validity of class and type ratings shall be 1 year, except for single-pilot single-engine class ratings, for which the period of validity shall be 2 years, unless otherwise determined by the operational suitability data, established in accordance with Part-21.

### Revalidation of single-pilot single-engine class ratings

1. Within the 3 months preceding the expiry date of the rating, pass a proficiency check in the relevant class in accordance with Appendix 9 to this Part with an examiner; or

2. Within the 12 months preceding the expiry date of the rating, complete 12 hours of flight time in the relevant class, including:
   1. 6 hours as PIC,
   2. 12 take-offs and 12 landings, and
   3. refresher training of at least 1 hour of total flight time with a flight instructor (FI) or a class rating instructor (CRI). Applicants shall be exempted from this refresher training if they have passed a class or type rating proficiency check, skill test or assessment of competence in any other class or type of aeroplane.

When applicants hold both a single-engine piston aeroplane-land class rating and a TMG rating, they may complete the requirements of (1) in either class or a combination thereof, and achieve revalidation of both ratings.

## FCL.810 - Night rating

"Night" means the period between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight or such other period between sunset and sunrise as may be prescribed by the appropriate authority.

Civil Twilight begins in the morning, or ends in the evening, when the geometric center of the sun is 6 degrees below the horizon. At Greenwich, England (51.5°N), the duration of civil twilight will vary from 33 minutes to 48 minutes, depending on the time of year. At the equator, civil twilight can last as little as 24 minutes.

### Training course

1. If the privileges of an LAPL, an SPL or a PPL for aeroplanes, TMGs or airships are to be exercised in VFR conditions at night, applicants shall have completed a training course at an ATO. The course shall comprise:
   1. theoretical knowledge instruction;
   2. at least 5 hours of flight time in the appropriate aircraft category at night, including at least 3 hours of dual instruction, including at least 1 hour of cross-country navigation with at least one dual cross-country flight of at least 50 km (27 NM) and 5 solo take-offs and 5 solo full-stop landings.
2. Before completing the training at night, LAPL holders shall have completed the basic instrument flight training required for the issue of the PPL.
3. When applicants hold both a single-engine piston aeroplane (land) and a TMG class rating, they may complete the requirements in (1) above in either class or both classes.

## FCL.060 - Recent experience

### Aeroplanes, helicopters, powered-lift, airships and sailplanes

A pilot shall not operate an aircraft in commercial air transport or carrying passengers:

1. as PIC or co-pilot unless he/she has carried out, in the preceding 90 days, at least 3 take-offs, approaches and landings in an aircraft of the same type or class or an FFS representing that type or class. The 3 take-offs and landings shall be performed in either multi-pilot or single-pilot operations, depending on the privileges held by the pilot; and
2. as PIC at night unless he/she:
   1. has carried out in the preceding 90 days at least 1 take-off, approach and landing at night as a pilot flying in an aircraft of the same type or class or an FFS representing that type or class; or
   2. holds an IR;

## Instrument rating

"Cross-country" means a flight between a point of departure and a point of arrival following a pre-planned route, using standard navigation procedures.

### FCL.610 IR — Prerequisites and crediting

Applicants for an IR shall:

1. hold:
   1. at least a PPL in the appropriate aircraft category, and:
      1. the privileges to fly at night in accordance with FCL.810, if the IR privileges will be used at night; or
   2. a CPL, in the appropriate aircraft category;
2. have completed at least 50 hours of cross-country flight time as PIC in aeroplanes, TMGs, helicopters or airships, of which at least 10 or, in the case of airships, 20 hours shall be in the relevant aircraft category;

### IFR vs. IMC time

In the EASA world it is possible to log IFR hours any time on an IFR flight plan in the IFR-certified airplane, regardless of conditions outside. For FAA, we cannot log instrument time in VMC regardless of our flight rules. This is one of the essential differences between the two authorities.

### Training course

The course consists of two modules, which may be taken separately or combined:

1. Basic Instrument Flight Module (10 hours)
2. Procedural Instrument Flight Module (40 hours SE / 45 hours /ME)

### FCL.625 IR — Validity, revalidation and renewal

1. Validity. An IR shall be valid for 1 year.
2. Revalidation.
   1. An IR shall be revalidated within the 3 months immediately preceding the expiry date of the rating.
   2. Applicants who fail to pass the relevant section of an IR proficiency check before the expiry date of the IR shall not exercise the IR privileges until they have passed the proficiency check.
3. Renewal. If an IR has expired, in order to renew their privileges applicants shall:
   1. go through refresher training at an ATO to reach the level of proficiency needed to pass the instrument element of the skill test in accordance with Appendix 9 to this Part; and
   2. complete a proficiency check in accordance with Appendix 9 to this Part, in the relevant aircraft category.
4. If the IR has not been revalidated or renewed within the preceding 7 years, the holder will be required to pass again the IR theoretical knowledge examination and skill test.
